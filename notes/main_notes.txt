# nil
nil is an object
nil has a few methods defined for it ( .inspect, .nil?, .to_s )

# objects
all objects have seperate object_id's
if you call .clone on an object, it creates another object with seperate object_id

# arrays
arrays are indexed starting at [0, 1, 2, 3]
arrays and ranges are not the same thing
you can call .to_a on a range to turn it into an array
slicing an array with a range:
array = ["hi", "bye", "fly", "sky"]
array[0..2] = ["hi", "bye", "fly"]
array[2..-1] = ["fly", "sky"]

.push("something") pushes "something" into the last space of an array
.pop pop's the last item off of an array
.unshift("something") pushes "something" into the first space of an array
.shift pop's the first item off of an array
